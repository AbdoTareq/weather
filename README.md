# weather

A simple weather app.

## Getting Started To run the project

Run the following commands

1. `flutter pub get`
2. create the api key to the `.env` file with the name `API_KEY`
3. `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` for generating the build files
4. `flutter run`

## I've used envied to handle the API-KEY to not be exposed in the project files & to auto encrypt the API-KEY

## I've used hydrated_bloc to cash data to display the last cached data when the application opens without internet connection

## I've used request_inspector to debug network calls

## To see the result install the apk attached apk file with the repo
